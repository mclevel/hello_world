Hi! My name is Marilyn. I am starting the BU masters in Data Science. My undergraduate degree is a B.S. of Neurological Pathways and Networks. I love all things science and I am fascinated by data science because it is a versatile field that will teach me the tools to get a deeper understanding of the data that supports the scientific findings I have always been inspired by. 

I love traveling, skydiving, and reading.
